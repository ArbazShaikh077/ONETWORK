# ONETWORK - Stay Up-to-Date with the Latest News

ONETWORK is a Flutter-based mobile application that lets you stay informed about the latest news from around the world. With an intuitive and user-friendly interface, you can browse through the latest news and get a quick overview of what's happening in the world, without having to read lengthy articles.

## Key Features

- View the latest news from a variety of sources
- Get a quick summary of each news article
- Save articles for later reading

## Summary Functionality (Coming Soon)

I am actively working on a feature that will provide a summary of each news article, so you don't have to read the whole article to stay informed. This feature is currently in development, but will be available soon.

## Why ONETWORK?

There are many news aggregators available, but ONETWORK stands out with its focus on providing quick and easy access to the latest news. Whether you're on the go or simply looking for a quick update, ONETWORK has you covered.
